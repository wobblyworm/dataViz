# Where to start

1. In "config.py" 
   - enter your own OpenAI API key
   - make sure "FILE_VHS", "FILE_DATA", "FILE_RAW" and "GPT_ENGINE" are correct
   - set "ASK_ONEONLY" to True if you want to ask gpt one question at a time (default is False) ==> not implemented yet
2. Run `surveyMgr.py`` (necessary files are hardcoded.. for now)
3. From the text menu go to (S)elect languages for VHS
4. select (0) all  or any of the specific available languages
5. Output will be written to "FILE_DATA" by default
6. Raw response from gpt is logged into "FILE_RAW"

# Encoding data
1. Run `analysisMgr.py` to encode "FILE_DATA" into CSV format

# Encoding dummy variables for regression
1. Makes sure CSV files and output files are correct in `wrangleCSV4regression.py`
2. Run `wrangleCSV4regression.py`
